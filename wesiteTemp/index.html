    <p>The Silesian Wars were a series of three
        wars fought between Prussia (under King Frederick the Great)
        and Austria (under Archduchess Maria Theresa) for control
        of the Central European region of Silesia (now in south-west Poland).
        The First (1740–1742) and Second Silesian Wars (1744–1745)
        formed parts of the War of the Austrian Succession, in which
        Prussia was one member of an anti-Austrian coalition.
